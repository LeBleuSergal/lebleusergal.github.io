<h2 style="font-size: 200%; font-family:Roadrage;"> Twitter rules</h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">If you've decided to follow my main Twitter account (that can be found on the main page of this site), you have to agree with some basic rules that I have set out. They are as follows:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-family:sans-serif">
	<li>Some of the content that I post on this account can be offensive to some people.</li>
	<li>I do not roleplay unless you're someone I know, and then, only in DMs.</li>
	<li>Do not try to ask me to promote you.</li>
	<li>If your behaviour is considered obnoxious (You spamming the account/bashing for no reason), you will get blocked.</li>
	<li>Any attempts on getting me involved in your personal drama (unless you're a close friend and have spoken to me at least once) will result in a soft block.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">I usually follow back accounts, however there is a spesific set of rules for that as well:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-family:sans-serif;">
	<li>I will follow back your account if the content you post is NOT NSFW (there are exceptions).</li>
	<li>I will not follow back if you're known for notorious behaviour.</li>
	<li>I will not follow back "+18 RP" or "Rule 34" accounts, regardless of content being posted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-size: 200%; font-family:Roadrage;"> Instagram rules</h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">The Instagram account that is provided on the main page is highly personal and contains real life images of myself, friends and family - therefore locked. You will be allowed to follow this account if:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-family:sans-serif;">
		<li>You're someone I know and have met IRL (In real life).</li>
		<li>You're a close friend to me that I've known for a while. (Applies to internet friendships.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-size: 200%; font-family:Roadrage;"> Steam rules</h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif;">My Steam account is open to nearly anyone. I most likely will accept any request that is sent to me, however I will reject any invites to game-oriented groups (Such as CSGO clans and so on).
<br>If you want to play games - I'll gladly do so, however mostly it will be without voicechat, since recently my headphones broke.<br>As for chatting, I'd prefer using Twitter or Telegram (which will not be disclosed publicly.)</p>
<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 150%;">Thank you for reading!</h4>
